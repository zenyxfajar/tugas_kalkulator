### About project

  - This Scientific Calculator Program Project created for Pemrograman Dasar Lecture Assignement. 
  - Program written in `C++` containing 15 menu of calculation including basic operation, exponential, trigonometry and logarithm.
  - For standar operation and trigonometri, output formatted to display a decimal with four significant digit.

### How the program work?

  - Program mostly in CLI
  - To start using the program, user will have run the program first
  - Then it will show the main menu of the program, containing 15 choice of calculation menu

  - Valid input is an integer number between `1` to `15`, if user give `0` to the `input`, it will `exit` the program
  - Once user select a menu, the program will ask whether the user pick the correct menu

  - If user say `Yes` or `Y` the program then will continue and user can start input number to be calculated
  - After calculation is done, it will ask the user if they want to continue or not, by giving input `Y` program will continue and ended if input is `N`

  - If input is `Y` it will erase last calculation result and display the main menu

  - If input is `N` it will exit the program

 ### Division by zero
  - Division by zero will throw an `Math ERROR:` message.
  - The user then will be asked to input the new denominator

 ### Out of range
  - The inverse of sine and cosine input are defined in radian which have range between `-1 to 1` as stated in the `C++` documentation.
  - If input is `input > 1 ` or `input < -1` program will throw `MATH ERROR:` message.
  - The user will need to input a new number
